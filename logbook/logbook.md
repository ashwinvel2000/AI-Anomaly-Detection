1. Build the web app skeleton
2. The Report Generationlanding page comes under 'Views'
   - Written in cshtml - cshtml is called razor view (html containing razor islands (@something) that converts the code into C# behind the scenes
3. Figured out why the Web UI didnt open like Andys
  - Added Bootstrap and JQuery library
  - Learned there are better alternatives
      - Tailwind CSS for Bootstrap
      - Vanilla JS for JQuery
